# Session Report: LangGraph Router Agent V2 Implementation
**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Focus**: Tool Calling Integration & Architecture Cleanup

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a clean LangGraph architecture with working tool calling for Home Assistant integration. The system now properly calls HA tools (like HassListAddItem) instead of hallucinating responses. Identified and documented the path forward for web search integration.

---

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. Created Router Agent V2 (`router_agent_v2.py`)

**New Features**:
- ✅ LangGraph StateGraph with checkpointing for distributed tool execution
- ✅ Parallel handler execution capability
- ✅ Proper tool integration with `bind_tools()`
- ✅ State management using reducers (`Annotated[List, operator.add]`)
- ✅ Maintains conversation state across HTTP calls using thread-based checkpointing

**Architecture**:
```
START → [router] → [parallel handlers] → [aggregator] → [agent] → {tools?}
                                                           ├─Yes→ END (return to HA)
                                                           └─No→ [formatter] → END
```

### 2. Fixed Tool Calling Issues

**Problems Identified**:
1. ❌ Handlers were adding confusing AIMessages before LLM could decide on tools
2. ❌ No system prompt instructing LLM to use tools
3. ❌ Router keywords didn't include shopping list/todo commands
4. ❌ Wrong model (mistral:7b has poor tool support)

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. ✅ Simplified handlers to NOT add AIMessages (router_agent_v2.py:190-258)
2. ✅ Added system prompt with clear tool usage instructions (router_agent_v2.py:285-294)
3. ✅ Extended router keywords to include "add", "list", "todo", "shopping", etc. (router_agent_v2.py:153-156)
4. ✅ Switched to `qwen2.5:3b` for better tool calling + speed

**Result**: Tool calling works perfectly! ✨
```
User: "Add potatoes to my shopping list"
  → LLM calls: HassListAddItem({'item': 'potatoes', 'name': 'shopping_list'})
  → HA executes tool
  → Returns: "I've added potatoes to your shopping list"
```

### 3. Implemented Comprehensive File Logging

**Log Files Created**:
- `logs/langchain_agent.log` - All application logs (rotating, 10MB max, 5 backups)
- `logs/langchain_agent_errors.log` - Error-only logs
- `logs/conversations/YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Daily human-readable conversation logs

**Benefits**:
- Easy debugging with conversation-specific logs
- Clear visibility into tool calls, LLM decisions, and graph execution
- Daily files make it simple to review specific interactions

**Documentation**: `docs/Logging.md` and `logs/README.md`

### 4. Updated Documentation

- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Updated architecture section, added logging commands
- ✅ `docs/Logging.md` - Comprehensive logging documentation
- ✅ `logs/README.md` - Quick reference for log files

## 📊 Current System State

### Model Configuration

| Purpose | Model | Reasoning |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Router | `llama3.2:3b` | Fast routing decisions |
| Tool Calling | `qwen2.5:3b` | Good tool support, ~2s response time |
| General Queries | `qwen2.5:3b` | Consistent with tool model |

**Note**: Tested `qwen3:30b-a3b` (30B parameters) - better accuracy but 7+ seconds per call. Reverted to 3B for speed.

### What's Working ✅

1. **Tool Calling for HA Actions**:
   - ✅ Shopping list (HassListAddItem)
   - ✅ Todo lists (HassListCompleteItem)
   - ✅ Device control (HassTurnOn, HassTurnOff)
   - ✅ All 8 Home Assistant tools properly exposed

2. **Checkpointing**:
   - ✅ State persists across HTTP calls
   - ✅ Conversation ID tracking
   - ✅ Multiple tool rounds supported

3. **Routing**:
   - ✅ Keyword-based routing to IOT/General handlers
   - ✅ Proper keyword coverage for common commands

4. **Logging**:
   - ✅ Comprehensive debugging capability
   - ✅ Easy conversation tracking
   - ✅ Daily organization

### Known Issues ⚠️

#### 1. Search Handler Not Integrated

**Problem**: Search queries don't work properly
```
Query: "What happened between the Australian PM and Trump yesterday?"
  ✅ Router selects 'search' route
  ✅ Search handler calls Tavily API
  ❌ Results added as AIMessage (confuses LLM)
  ❌ LLM doesn't use results properly
  ❌ Returns "I don't have real-time information"
```

**Root Cause**:
- Search handler uses old architecture (adds content as messages)
- Tavily search not exposed as a tool to the LLM
- Home Assistant's 8 tools don't include web search

**Impact**: Web search queries fail despite Tavily integration

#### 2. Search Handler Architecture Mismatch

Current handlers:
- **IOT Handler**: Routes to tools ✅
- **General Handler**: Routes to LLM ✅
- **Search Handler**: Does its own thing ❌

The search handler doesn't fit the tool-calling architecture.

## 🔄 How Tool Calling Currently Works

### Flow for HA Tool Calls

```
1. User Query → FastAPI Server
2. Server calls agent.process(query, tools, ...)
3. Graph executes:
   - Router → Selects handler
   - Handler → Marks query type
   - Aggregator → (does nothing - clean slate for agent)
   - Agent → LLM with system prompt + tools
   - LLM → Decides to call tool
4. Graph returns tool_calls to server
5. Server returns to Home Assistant
6. HA executes tools (e.g., adds item to shopping list)
7. HA sends results back
8. Server calls agent.process(query, tools, tool_results, conversation_id)
9. Graph resumes from checkpoint:
   - Adds ToolMessages with results
   - Agent → LLM generates natural response
10. Returns final response
```

### Key Components

**Checkpointing** (router_agent_v2.py:93):
```python
self.checkpointer = MemorySaver()
self.graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=self.checkpointer)
```

**System Prompt** (router_agent_v2.py:285-294):
```python
SystemMessage(content="""You are a smart home assistant with access to various tools.

IMPORTANT: When the user asks you to perform an action, you MUST call the appropriate tool.
Do not just describe what you would do - actually call the tool.

Examples:
- "Add milk to shopping list" → Call HassListAddItem tool
...
""")
```

**Tool Separation Decision Point** (router_agent_v2.py:324-332):
```python
def _should_continue_to_tools(self, state):
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]

    if hasattr(last_message, "tool_calls") and last_message.tool_calls:
        return "tools"  # Return to HA for execution

    return "formatter"  # Generate final response
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Search Integration

**Recommended Approach**: Implement Tavily as a local tool

**Why This Approach**:
- Fits the tool-calling architecture
- LLM can decide when to search
- Results properly integrated into conversation
- Consistent with how we handle everything else

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. **Define Tavily as LangChain Tool**:
```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def tavily_search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for current information about events, news, and facts."""
    tavily = TavilySearch(api_key=TAVILY_API_KEY)
    results = tavily.invoke({"query": query})
    # Format top results
    return format_search_results(results)
```

2. **Create Mixed Tool Architecture**:
```python
# Bind both HA tools (from request) and local tools
local_tools = [tavily_search]
all_tools = tools + local_tools  # tools from HA + our tools
llm_with_tools = self.chat_device.bind_tools(all_tools)
```

3. **Implement Tool Call Separation**:
```python
def _separate_tool_calls(self, tool_calls):
    """Separate HA tools from local tools by name prefix."""
    ha_tools = [tc for tc in tool_calls if tc["name"].startswith("Hass")]
    local_tools = [tc for tc in tool_calls if not tc["name"].startswith("Hass")]
    return ha_tools, local_tools
```

4. **Update Graph with Local Tool Node**:
```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

workflow.add_node("local_tools", ToolNode([tavily_search]))

# Updated conditional edges
def should_continue(state):
    tool_calls = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls
    ha, local = separate_tool_calls(tool_calls)

    if ha:
        return "return_to_ha"  # END - HA must execute
    elif local:
        return "local_tools"  # Execute locally, loop back to agent
    else:
        return "formatter"  # No tools - final response
```

5. **Handle Mixed Tool Calls**:
   - **Option A (Simple)**: Disallow mixed calls - LLM must choose either HA or local
   - **Option B (Complex)**: Execute local tools first, then return HA tools
   - **Recommendation**: Start with Option A

**Graph Structure After Implementation**:
```
agent → {has tool calls?}
  ├─ HA tools only → END (return to HA)
  ├─ Local tools only → [local_tools] → agent (loop)
  └─ No tools → formatter → END
```

### Priority 2: Remove/Disable Current Search Handler

Once Tavily is a tool, remove the search handler:
```python
# In __init__
self.handlers: List[BaseHandler] = [
    IOTHandler(self.chat_router),
    # SearchHandler - REMOVED, using Tavily tool instead
    # GeneralHandler - REMOVED, not needed with IOT handler
]
```

Simplify to just IOT handler, let the agent decide everything.

### Priority 3: Consider Simplifying Handler Architecture

**Current**: Router → Handler → Aggregator → Agent
**Simpler**: Router → Agent (with tools)

Handlers don't do much anymore (they just mark the route). Consider:
- Remove handlers entirely
- Router just sets metadata
- Agent makes all decisions with tools

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner architecture
- Fewer nodes in graph
- Easier to understand
- Agent has full context

### Priority 4: Performance Optimization

**Current Issues**:
- Graph executes through multiple nodes even for simple queries
- Checkpointing adds overhead
- Multiple LLM calls (agent + formatter)

**Potential Improvements**:
1. **Remove formatter node**: Let agent generate final response directly
2. **Streaming**: Implement streaming responses for better UX
3. **Model tuning**: Test different models for speed/accuracy balance

### Priority 5: Production Readiness

**Current State**: Works great for development, needs hardening for production

**TODO**:
1. **Persistent Checkpointing**: Switch from MemorySaver to SqliteSaver
   ```python
   from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver
   checkpointer = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string("checkpoints.db")
   ```

2. **Error Handling**: Add try/catch around tool execution
3. **Timeout Management**: Handle slow LLM responses
4. **Rate Limiting**: Protect against excessive API calls
5. **Monitoring**: Add metrics/telemetry

## 💡 Design Decisions Made

### 1. Checkpointing Strategy
**Decision**: Use thread-based checkpointing with MemorySaver
**Rationale**: Simple, works for development, easy to upgrade to persistent later
**Trade-off**: State lost on server restart

### 2. Handler Simplification
**Decision**: Handlers don't add content, just mark route type
**Rationale**: Prevents confusing the LLM with pre-generated responses
**Impact**: Agent makes all decisions, cleaner message flow

### 3. Model Selection
**Decision**: qwen2.5:3b for tool calling
**Rationale**: Good tool support, fast responses (~2s), available locally
**Alternative Considered**: qwen3:30b-a3b (better but 7s response time)

### 4. Logging Architecture
**Decision**: Three separate log files (main, errors, conversations)
**Rationale**: Easy debugging, conversation tracking, error diagnosis
**Trade-off**: More files to manage

### 5. System Prompt Strategy
**Decision**: Prepend system message only when tools are available
**Rationale**: Clear instructions for tool use, doesn't confuse non-tool queries
**Location**: router_agent_v2.py:285-294

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check Tool Calls
```bash
# See if tools are being called
grep "TOOL CALLS REQUESTED" logs/conversations/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log

# Check for tool call failures
grep "LLM did not call tools" logs/langchain_agent.log
```

### View Conversation Flow
```bash
# Human-readable conversation log
cat logs/conversations/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log

# Detailed graph execution
grep "langchain_agent.LangChainRouterAgentV2" logs/langchain_agent.log | tail -50
```

### Find Errors
```bash
# All errors
cat logs/langchain_agent_errors.log

# Recent errors
tail -n 20 logs/langchain_agent_errors.log
```

### Test Specific Queries
```python
import asyncio
from langchain_agent.src.router_agent_v2 import LangChainRouterAgentV2

async def test():
    agent = LangChainRouterAgentV2()
    result = await agent.process(
        query="Add milk to my shopping list",
        tools=[...],  # HA tools
        conversation_id=None,
        tool_results=None
    )
    print(result)

asyncio.run(test())
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Handler Architecture Matters
**Problem**: Handlers adding AIMessages confused the LLM
**Solution**: Handlers should only mark metadata, not generate content
**Takeaway**: In agent systems, let the agent make all content decisions

### 2. System Prompts Are Critical
**Problem**: LLM had tools but didn't know to use them
**Solution**: Clear system prompt with examples
**Takeaway**: Explicit instructions > implicit behavior

### 3. LangGraph Checkpointing Power
**Problem**: Needed to maintain state across HTTP calls
**Solution**: Thread-based checkpointing with conversation IDs
**Takeaway**: LangGraph's checkpointing is powerful for distributed tool execution

### 4. Tool Naming Conventions Help
**Observation**: All HA tools start with "Hass"
**Benefit**: Easy to distinguish HA tools from local tools
**Takeaway**: Naming conventions enable simple separation logic

### 5. Logging Is Essential
**Problem**: Hard to debug what happened in conversations
**Solution**: Comprehensive file logging with daily conversation logs
**Takeaway**: Good logging saves hours of debugging
